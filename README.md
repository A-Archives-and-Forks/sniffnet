## Required dependencies

Depending on your operating system, you may need to install some dependencies to run Sniffnet:

<details>

  <summary>Windows dependencies&emsp;<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100347457/193474292-d84f2a96-f445-40ac-8930-9d0f00a3c2bb.png" width="35px"/></summary>

  In order to correctly build and run Sniffnet on Windows systems you need to:

  - Install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download), making sure to check the box `Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode` during the installation.

  - Download the [Npcap SDK](https://npcap.com/#download).

  - Add the SDK's ```/Lib/x64``` (or ```/Lib```) folder to your ```LIB``` environment variable.

> **Note**
>
> If you just need to run the app, perform only the first step (second and third steps are required only for the build).

</details>


<details>

  <summary>Linux dependencies&emsp;<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100347457/193474239-c48d37af-d4c1-4a94-9207-0d46c6d75f1f.png" width="35px"/></summary>

  - On [Debian-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based) distributions:
    - `libpcap-dev`
    - `libasound2-dev`
    - `libfontconfig1-dev`
  - On [RPM-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#RPM-based) distributions:
    - `libpcap-devel`
    - `alsa-lib-devel`
    - `fontconfig-devel`

> **Note**
>
> If you just need to run the app, the `-dev` / `-devel` part of the dependencies is not needed (it's required only for the build).

  Note that if you are not running as root, you need to set capabilities to inspect a network adapter:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip <your/Sniffnet/executable/path>
```

  Alternatively you can run the app with sudo privileges:

```sh
sudo sniffnet
```

</details>


<details>

  <summary>MacOS dependencies&emsp;<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100347457/193474398-7637e269-3e92-44bc-87c0-8ea18ca95693.png" width="35px"/></summary>

  MacOS natively has all the dependencies you need to build and run Sniffnet! <br>
  However, remember to run the app with administrator privileges: this is needed to analyse the activity of your network device.

## IP geolocation and network providers (ASN)

<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

  <br>

  Geolocation and network providers (ASN) refer to the remote IP address of each connection. They are retrieved performing lookups against [MMDB files](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/):

  > **Note**
  >
  > The MMDB (MaxMind database) format has been developed especially for IP lookup.<br>
  > It is optimized to perform lookups on data indexed by IP network ranges quickly and efficiently.<br>
  > It permits the best performance on IP lookups, and it's suitable for use in a production environment.
  >
  > This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from <a href="https://www.maxmind.com">https://www.maxmind.com </a>

  This file format potentially allows Sniffnet to execute hundreds of different IP lookups in a matter of a few milliseconds.

</details>


## Supported application layer protocols

<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

  <br>

  Application layer protocols are inferred from the transport port numbers,
  following the convention maintained by [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml).

  Please, remember that this is just a convention:

  > **Warning**
  >
  > The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for maintaining
  > the official assignments of port numbers for specific uses. <br>
  > However, many unofficial uses of well-known port numbers occur in practice.

  The following table reports the port-to-service mappings used by Sniffnet,
  chosen from the most common assignments by IANA.

<div align="center">

|Port number(s)|Application protocol  |  Description |
|--|--|--|
| 20, 21 | FTP |File Transfer Protocol |
|22|SSH |Secure Shell |
|23|Telnet |Telnet |
|25|SMTP |Simple Mail Transfer Protocol |
|49|TACACS |Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System |
|53|DNS |Domain Name System |
|67, 68|DHCP |Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol |
|69|TFTP |Trivial File Transfer Protocol |
|80, 8080|HTTP |Hypertext Transfer Protocol |
|109, 110|POP |Post Office Protocol |
|123|NTP |Network Time Protocol |
|137, 138, 139|NetBIOS |NetBIOS |
|143, 220|IMAP |Internet Message Access Protocol |
|161, 162, 199|SNMP |Simple Network Management Protocol |
|179|BGP |Border Gateway Protocol |
|389|LDAP |Lightweight Directory Access Protocol |
|443|HTTPS |Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS |
|636|LDAPS |Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over TLS/SSL |
|989, 990|FTPS |File Transfer Protocol over TLS/SSL |
|993|IMAPS |Internet Message Access Protocol over TLS/SSL |
|995|POP3S |Post Office Protocol 3 over TLS/SSL |
|1900|SSDP |Simple Service Discovery Protocol |
|5222|XMPP |Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol |
|5353|mDNS |Multicast DNS |

## Keyboard shortcuts

<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

<br>

Some keyboard shortcuts are available to improve the efficiency of use and the overall user experience.

If you want to suggest a different key combination for one of the existing shortcuts or if you want to propose a new shortcut,
have a look at [this](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/97) issue.

The currently usable hotkeys are reported in the following.

> **Note**
>
> On macOS, use the `cmd` key instead of `ctrl`

<div align="center">

| Event | Shortcut keys |
|--|--|
| Quit the application | `ctrl+Q` |
| Open full report | `ctrl+O` |
| Open settings | `ctrl+,` |
| Clear all notifications | `ctrl+D` |
| Interrupt the ongoing analysis | `ctrl+backspace` |
| Start the analysis and confirm modal actions | `enter` |
| Close settings and modal popups | `esc` |
| Switch from a tab to the next (or previous) one | `tab` (or `shift+tab`) |
| Change inspect connections page to the next (or previous) one | `ctrl+rightArrow` (or `ctrl+leftArrow`) |

</div>

</details>

## Custom themes
<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

  Custom themes are specified as a TOML file.

  The TOML must follow this format:
  ```toml
  # Color palettes are in RGBA hexadecimal where the alpha is optional.
  primary = "#1e1e2e"           # Base
  secondary = "#89b4fa"         # Blue
  buttons = "#313244"           # Surface0
  outgoing = "#f5c2e7"          # Pink
  text_headers = "#11111b"      # Crust
  text_body = "#cdd6f4"         # Text
  starred = "#f9e2af"           # Yellow

  # Alpha channels are floats within [0.0, 1.0]
  round_borders_alpha = 0.1
  round_containers_alpha = 0.15
  chart_badge_alpha = 0.75

  # Night or dark themes should be specified here
  nightly = true
  ```

  The example theme above uses colors from [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).
</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that can occur are likely due to your system missing required `pcap` dependencies,
necessary to correctly analyze a network adapter. <br>
Check the [required dependencies](#required-dependencies) section for instructions on how to proceed, depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

<<<<<<< HEAD
In some cases, especially if you are running on an old architecture, the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may cause some problems that could prevent you from running Sniffnet. <br>
In this case, you can try building the application from the [`glow-renderer`](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/glow-renderer)
branch, which uses the `glow` renderer.

> **Note**
>
> View issues labeled with [`renderer`](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Arenderer) to see how those problems have been solved by others.

=======
In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not up-to-date,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may cause problems (country icons are completely black, or the interface glitches). <br>
In these cases you can download an alternative version of the application,
which is based on `tiny-skia`, a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment: <br>
