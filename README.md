## Installation

You can install Sniffnet in one of the following ways:

<details>

  <summary>from Crates.io&ensp;<img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/crates/d/sniffnet?color=success&label=downloads&logo=rust"/></summary>

  Follow this method only if you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine. <br>
  In this case, the application binary can be installed with: 

```sh
cargo install sniffnet
```
    
</details>


<details>

  <summary>from GitHub releases&ensp;<img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gyulyvgc/sniffnet/total?color=success&logo=github"/></summary>

  You can install Sniffnet through the installers available in the [latest release](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/releases). <br>
  Choose between a Windows installer, a DEB package, or a macOS disk image (depending on your operating system).
    
</details>


<!--
<details>

  <summary>from Homebrew&ensp;<img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/homebrew/installs/dm/sniffnet?color=success&logo=homebrew"/></summary>

  You can install Sniffnet's brew package with:
  
  ```sh
brew install sniffnet
```
    
</details>
-->


## Required dependencies

Depending on your operating system, you may need to install some dependencies to run Sniffnet:

<details>

  <summary>Windows dependencies&emsp;<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100347457/193474292-d84f2a96-f445-40ac-8930-9d0f00a3c2bb.png" width="35px"/></summary>

  In order to correctly run Sniffnet on Windows systems you need to:

  - Install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download).

  - Download the [Npcap SDK](https://npcap.com/#download).

  - Add the SDK's ```/Lib``` or ```/Lib/x64``` folder to your ```LIB``` environment variable.
    
</details>


<details>

  <summary>Linux dependencies&emsp;<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100347457/193474239-c48d37af-d4c1-4a94-9207-0d46c6d75f1f.png" width="35px"/></summary>
 
  In order to correctly run Sniffnet on Linux systems, install the libraries and header files for the libpcap library: 
  
```sh
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
```

  Note that if you are not running as root, you need to set capabilities to inspect a network adapter: 
  
```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip <your/Sniffnet/executable/path>
```

Most Linux system also need this dependency (required to build the library used to play sounds):

```sh
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

Depending on your Linux environment you may also need `libfontconfig`:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig libfontconfig1-dev
```
    
</details>


<details>

  <summary>MacOS dependencies&emsp;<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100347457/193474398-7637e269-3e92-44bc-87c0-8ea18ca95693.png" width="35px"/></summary>

  MacOS natively has all the dependencies you need to build and run Sniffnet!

## Features

- üíª choose a network adapter to inspect
- üè∑Ô∏è select filters to apply to the observed traffic
- üìà view real-time charts about traffic intensity (bytes and packets per second, incoming and outgoing)
- üîâ set custom notifications to inform you when defined network events occur (data rate exceeded a specified threshold, or new data have been exchanged from your favorite connections)
- üìñ view overall statistics about the filtered traffic
- ‚≠ê view most relevant connections in real time (most recent, most packets, most bytes, favorites)
- üåç get information about the country of the remote address (IP Geolocation)
- üìÅ save complete textual report with detailed information for each connection:
  * source and destination IP addresses
  * source and destination ports
  * carried protocols
  * amount of exchanged packets and bytes
  * initial and final timestamp of information exchange
- ... and more!
  

## IP Geolocation

<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

  Geolocation refers to the remote IP address of the connection, and it's performed against a [MMDB file](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/):

  > The MMDB (MaxMind database) format has been developed especially for IP lookup. It is optimized to perform lookups on data indexed by IP network ranges quickly and efficiently. If you want the best performance on your IP lookups for use in a production environment, you should use the MMDB format files.
  
  This format potentially allows Sniffnet to execute different hundreds of IP lookups in a matter of a few milliseconds.

  Sometimes it is not possible to determine the location of an IP address; this is most likely due to the address being a private IP address.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

  <summary>See details</summary>

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that can occur are likely due to your system missing required `pcap` dependencies,
necessary to correctly analyze a network adapter. <br>
Check the [required dependencies](#required-dependencies) section for instructions on how to proceed.

For a Windows reference, you can check issue [#1](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/1).

Note that most Linux system also need this dependency (required to build the library used to play sounds):

```sh
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

Some Linux systems also need `libfontconfig`, see issue [#18](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/18) for a reference.

### Installers incompatibilities

If you have problems after having installed Sniffnet through the provided installers,
it could be due to your OS not being compatible with the pre-built binaries I generated for you. <br>
Reach me out, and I'll try to generate an installer for your specific operating system.

### ***In any case don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues), and I will do my best to help you!***
