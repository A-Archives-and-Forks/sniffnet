## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Sniffnet is an application to make Internet traffic analysis easily understandable to the vast majority of people, even if they are not networking expert.

Although, at the same time, Sniffnet tries to convey information that can be useful to effectively monitor the network traffic,
with many additional functionalities planned for the future releases.

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/gyulyvgc/sniffnet/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: ðŸ’…required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. Clone the public Figma files if available or create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and I promise I will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

**We encourage you to:**

- Get in touch with me by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/gyulyvgc/sniffnet/discussions).
- Check out our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## ðŸš€ Our Main Product

Sniffnet can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/releases)

### Target audience

All users with a decent amount of technological knowledge. Typical users' age ranges from 16 to 60.

### Design files

> Since I do not have a design team at hand â€“ most of my product does not have any Design files and you'll be forced to browse through the product itself and propose improvements.

## ðŸ’… Design relevant materials

Here is a list of design relevant information and materials:

### Fonts

I'm using `Couries Sans` for everything except for the chart, for which I'm using `notosans`. The fonts I used can be found [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/main/fonts).

### Colors

For info on the used RGB colors, I suggest you to give a look at the file [style.rs](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/src/gui/style.rs#L58-L91)

### Logos

You can find a set of logos [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/main/resources)

## ðŸŽ“ License

[MIT](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) or [APACHE 2.0](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE) at your choice.
